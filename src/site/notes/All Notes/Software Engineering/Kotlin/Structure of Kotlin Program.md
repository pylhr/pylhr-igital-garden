- Like Java and other alike languages `main()` function is the point from which kotlin program starts executing.
- The basic structure of program is this :
```kotlin
		//main function
		fun main(){
		//body
		println("Hello World!")
		}
```

### How the code is executed?

- Kotlin is a JVM compatible language.
- Java Virtual Machine(JVM) is a virtual machine which allows computers or programs which are written in other languages which are also converted to java bytecode.
- And JVM compatible language is a language which executer perfectly on JVM. JVM is responsible for loading, verifying and executing the java bytecode.
