- Java is a blend of the best elements of its rich heritage.
- Computer language innovation and development occur for two reason :
	- To adapt to changing environments and uses
	- To implement refinements and improvements in the art of programming
- Java derives its syntax from C, and object oriented features from C++.
- Following tradeoffs are made when a computer language is designed such as :
	- Ease of use VS power
	- Safety VS efficiency
	- Rigidity VS extensibility
- Prior to C programmers had to choose between languages that optimized one set of traits over the other.
- Another compounding problem was that early computer languages such as FORTRAN, BASIC, COBOL etc were not designed around structured principles, instead they relied upon GOTO as primary means of program control.
