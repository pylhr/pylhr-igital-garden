- A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

## Why is it important?

- They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
- They help to manage and organize data.
- They make code cleaner and easier to understand.


## Abstract Data Type

- An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.
- The interface does not provide any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

### Example

| ADT     | Implementation(DS)                                            |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| List    | [[All Notes/Software Engineering/Data Structures & Algorithms/Static & Dynamic Array\| Dynamic Array]], Linked List       |
| Queue   | Linked List based Queue, Array based queue, Stack based queue |
| Map     | Tree Map, Hash Map / Hash Table                               |
| Vehicle | Golf Cart, Bicycle, Motor Bike, Sports Car                    |
