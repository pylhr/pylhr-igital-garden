## What is Java?

Java is a robust, object-oriented programming language created by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and now owned by Oracle. It powers over **3 billion** devices and is the backbone of many Android apps, enterprise systems, and large-scale web applications.

## Why Choose Java?

Java’s "write once, run anywhere" philosophy makes it platform-independent, allowing it to run on Windows, Mac, Linux, and more. It’s one of the most sought-after languages in the job market due to its reliability, ease of use, and extensive community support. Java’s strong security features, speed, and open-source nature make it ideal for building everything from mobile apps to server-side applications. With a syntax similar to C++ and C#, it’s also a great stepping stone for developers looking to expand their programming expertise.
